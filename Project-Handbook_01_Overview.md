Overview
--------

Projects are one of the primary methods by which OWASP strives to
achieve its mission, which is to make application security more visible.
OWASP Projects provide a community based, online platform that allows
Project Leaders the opportunity to freely test ideas and theories in an
open environment. Leaders are able to leverage the OWASP brand, and the
help of a dedicated OWASP Project Manager to guide development. The goal
of an OWASP Project is to create a concrete deliverable - such as a
document, a tool, or a code library - that furthers the OWASP mission.
OWASP Projects are divided into the following major categories:

-   Documentation Projects: These projects seek to communicate
    information or raise awareness about a topic in

application security. Note that documentation projects can take any
media form (e.g. CBT, videos, games, etc.) and are not limited to a
print deliverable.

-   Tool Projects: Tool projects aim to create software that enables
    users to test, detect, protect, or educate

themselves using a facet of application security.

-   Code Library Projects: These projects provide libraries/frameworks
    that can be leveraged by developers to

enhance the security of their applications.

-   Operational Projects: These projects are a bit different than the
    types above. They were created to offer

OWASP operational support. Some examples of operational projects include
the OWASP Media Project whose contributors work on managing the OWASP
YouTube channel along with working towards developing media content for
the Foundation.

As with all OWASP groups, OWASP Projects are driven by volunteers, and
they are open to everyone. This means that anyone can lead a project,
anyone can contribute to a project, and anyone can use a project. This
handbook is meant to be the primary reference for OWASP Project Leaders,
and it should serve as a useful starting point for anyone that wishes to
start their own project within the OWASP organization.
